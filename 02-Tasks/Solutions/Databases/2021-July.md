# Задача 1:
```sql
SELECT code, price FROM Laptop
WHERE screen BETWEEN 13 AND 15
AND ram IN (SELECT ram
            FROM PC);
```

# Задача 2:
```sql
SELECT maker, COUNT(code)
FROM Laptop
RIGHT JOIN Product
ON Laptop.model = Product.model
AND screen = 15
GROUP BY maker;
```

## Oбосновка
За А)
- This is an INNER JOIN that will drop any manufacturer who doesn't produce laptops, failing the main requirement.
- COUNT(screen = 15) is non-standard SQL.

За В) и Г)
- The HAVING clause is used to filter groups after they have been created, and it must be used with an aggregate function (like COUNT, SUM, etc.).
- HAVING screen = 15 is incorrect because you cannot use it to filter based on a non-aggregated column value. That is the job of the WHERE clause (or, in this specific problem, the ON clause).
